AI's impacts on scholarship (as opposed to education) are almost entirely positive.

The one potential risk of AI is that an over-estimation of an AI model's capabilities may lead to factually incorrect scholarship.  Take for example an AI "driving a car": every now and then the car will hit people, and everybody is very careful that they have a working AI before it is allowed on the road.
