# Pleiades vs the Barrington Atlas

Pleiades is an expansion of the Barrington Atlas from a print-book with certain material constraints (e.g. it is hard to display survey data) to a digital resource that can display relevant data of all types in a coherent manner.

A gazetteer is a geographic index, or a traditional list/dataset connected with a map.  Pleiades is a digital gazetteer because the digital map is far more precise and stable than other digital maps avaliable:  coordinates can be cited and cross-referenced easily between users and accross time, all resource identifiers are longstanding citation points rather than arbitrary and fluid tags in the latest update of the computer program.
