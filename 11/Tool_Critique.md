# CLASS 11 CRITIQUE

## Pompeii

- Permanence: B *The meat of this site is the .obj file.  Although the .obj file is permanent in the way a book is permanent (somebdody can download the .obj file from openheritage and maintain it themselves), the classroom portion would become a dead link if cloud hosting on the third party sketchfab was revoked.*

- Openness: A *The full measurements of the project can be obtained from the .obj file*

- Functionality: B *The 3D model isn't super accessible, and it would be more interesting if there were other ways for students to view it beyond birds-eye 3D and "VR"*

- Connectivity: C *This was a self-contained installation.*

## Searchable Inscriptions

- Permanence: B *The website seems simple and self-contained.  It feels like this website should be easily transferrable to an encyclopedia format, but given that it did not offer a download or book purchase option I cannot give it an A because I would have no easy way of preserving the data in my own personal posession.*

- Openness: A *You can access everything on this site, and because this isn't translation, there are probably far fewer editorial decisions that I would need to be informed of to understand the content.*

- Functionality: A *It dosen't say much to me because it's in other languages, but Packard says in that introduction that the user base for this is academics, and for them it seems useful.* 

- Connectivity: C *As far as I could tell, this project was entirely self-contained.*
