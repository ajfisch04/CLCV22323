## Pompeii

- Permanence: B *The meat of this site is the .obj file.  Although the .obj file is permanent in the way a book is permanent (somebdody can download the .obj file from openheritage and maintain it themselves), the classroom portion would become a dead link if cloud hosting on the third party sketchfab was revoked.*

- Openness: A *The full measurements of the project can be obtained from the .obj file*

- Functionality: B *The 3D model isn't super accessible, and it would be more interesting if there were other ways for students to view it beyond birds-eye 3D and "VR"*

- Connectivity: C *This was a self-contained installation.*
