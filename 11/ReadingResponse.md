3D modeling has assisted archaelogists by allowing the study of objects remotely through detailed digital representations that capture both an object's surface texture and appearance.  There are many product options within 3D modeling technology with different tradeoffs including portability and cost.  For example, 3D modeling at a remote archaeological site on a limited budget versus a museum with lots of money to spend would likely use different technology.
