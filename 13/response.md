Augumented reality adds two types of information to historical sites and museums: information strictly about the site, and information that contextualizes the site.  In the case of the roman ampatheater, the information contained in the 3d site model was simply expressing what the historic site would have looked like before the degredation of time.  In the museum, the 3D walkthrough was almost a new "artwork" layered on top of the physical artwork that didn't have a very strong connection to a cannonical viewing experience.
