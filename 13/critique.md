## Inscriptions Israel Palistine

- Permanence: B *Given that this appears to be an agglomeration of published works collected in cloud-hosting, you could easily imagine this going offline without recovery options in a library or something similar.  You can download their data, though, so it is more likely that you could find somebody that had saved it for themselves.*

- Openness: A *All bibliographies are made avaliable on a site called Zotero, which is open-source and can be queried with an API.*

- Functionality: B *The icons on the map are hard to read.  When you're zoomed out, all the circles crowd onto each other.  When you zoom in and the higher-resolution topography kicks in, it becomes hard to see many of the transparent colors, especially the light blue they used for the "byzantinie provinces" overlay.*

- Connectivity: A *Bibliography that clearly links to other acacdemic sources.*
