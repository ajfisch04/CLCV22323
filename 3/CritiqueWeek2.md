# WEEK 2 CRITIQUE

## Orbis

- Permanence: A *Orbis seems to operate it's own map locally*

- Openness: C *Orbis dosen't make a change log easily avaliable*

- Functionality: A *Orbis uses the map functionality to plot things like regions and trade routes that enhance my understanding of the historic sites.  This even includes route-finding and cartograms.*

- Connectivity: B *I didn't run into any log-ins or restrictions on my access, but it was never made clear whether these restrictions might exist.*

## Pleiades

- Permanence: C *Pilades appears to manage it's map through a third-party tool called mapbox, making the site unreliable in the long term*

- Openness: A *Pleiades offers a change log in an easily accessible main menu*

- Functionality: C *The Pleiades map is an overlay of the modern world, with a ring road around Rome for example.  This map dosen't add much to my understanding of the sites, I might as well have a paper book with a map pull-out and an indexed list of historic sites* 

- Connectivity: A *Pleiades clarifies that all data is open for download*
