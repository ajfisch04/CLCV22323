    <h1>Cantina Review</h1>
    I went to the Taco Bell Cantina, here's what it was like.
    
    <h3>The Crowd</h3>
    The crowd was entertaining to watch, two couples on dates and a group of teenagers. 5/5
    
    <h3>Interior Design</h3>
    Lots of exposed brick and wood.  Especially appreciated were the the eight outlet boxes along each wall.  5/5
    
    <h3>The Music</h3>
    The music wasn't very good, I wore my headphones instead of listening to it.  2/5
    
    <h3>The Food</h3>
    My five layer burrito was well above average quality for an already delicious dish.  The rolled tacos, though, were not great.  4/5
