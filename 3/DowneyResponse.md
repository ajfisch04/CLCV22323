A variable is a keyword that stores a value.  This value is "initialized" at some point in the code, the variable's value can be used/called in functions or changed at any point thereafter.  Variables have some naming conventions and cannot conflict with words reserved by the programming language for it's own use, so the name of the variable could be a source of errors.

A parameter is a subtype of variable used in a function.  When a function is initialized in the code as taking a variable as an input, this variable is a "parameter".

An argument is anything input taken by a function.  This includes variables e.g. "parameters" but can also be other things.
