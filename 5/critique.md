## Perseus Digital Library

- Openness:  A, I never ran into any password-locked pages.

- Functionality:  A, data was searchable in many ways including by terms included in the text.

- Connectivity: C, it looked like most of their collections were "internal" rather than external and therefore linked relatively fewer resources outside of their own library system.

# RESPONSE

Differences between the types of normal forms:

1st: each row must be unique (this can be accomplished by indexing rows with IDs) and each column must hold a single piece of non-divisible information (this means lists must be broken up into tables).

2nd: the database must be in first normal form, PLUS any information not directly dependent on all columns must be removed to it's own table (this increases efficiency).

3rd: the database must be in first and second normal form, PLUS all information not directly lined to the "key" index column must be exiled to a seperate table.

In sum, data normalization means simplifying redundant information by moving various types of data to tables.
