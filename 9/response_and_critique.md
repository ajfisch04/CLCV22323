## Homer Multitext

- Permanence: A, their archival data is published publicly in "plain-text" formats that can be easily downloaded for safekeeping by third parties.

- Openness: A, digital editions are published at a github repository accessible by anyone.

- Functionality: A, different ways of searching the archive including by Illiad reference or by alphabetical greek-language query.

- Connectivity: C, as far as I can tell this is a pretty self-contained project.  If there are cross-citations, they are indexed in the actual texts rather than on the main portal.

## Digital Dead Sea Scrolls

- Permanence: C, this dosen't seem very clearly indexed to last and the reader window says "powered by google" while implies that this uses a subscription service from a cloud-hosting company that will eventually be depriciated.

- Openness: A, you can click in and see everything.

- Functionality: C, this is very good for a public-facing museum exhibit, but for scholars you would want both a way to download high-quality images of the text and a text file where you could read the whole thing in ancient script and translation without clicking through the graphic.

- Connectivity: C, there aren't really any cross-citations to other scholarly works.
