## Homer Multitext

- Permanence: A, their archival data is published publicly in "plain-text" formats that can be easily downloaded for safekeeping by third parties.

- Openness: A, digital editions are published at a github repository accessible by anyone.

- Functionality: A, different ways of searching the archive including by Illiad reference or by alphabetical greek-language query.

- Connectivity: C, as far as I can tell this is a pretty self-contained project.  If there are cross-citations, they are indexed in the actual texts rather than on the main portal.
