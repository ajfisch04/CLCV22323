SPARQL is a search function used to sift through Linked Open Data.  Because SPARQL is only a search function, it auguments other methods we have learned in this class instead of replacing them.  For example, SPARQL is sometimes executed from within a python notebook.  SPARQL is especially useful for creating network graphs between items in a table.
