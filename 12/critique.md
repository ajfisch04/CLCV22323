## Ancient Graffiti

- Permanence: A *The inscriptions represented in maps are academically published in shared databsases, these academic publications could be used to re-create the maps at any future date.*

- Openness: A *Above and beyond full public access, the scholarly materials are made avaliable through interactive maps easily navigable by non-specialists.  The "suggested citation" options and "export to csv" options were also very convenient.*

- Functionality: A *The functionality was obviously incredible.  One thing I wish was possible was a more detailed facade-level search.  If you wanted to do a social survey of life in the city or something, you might want to look at types of graffiti along each small segment of road because there might be different circulation patterns throughout the city.  The road segments offered in the map are too large for this kind of fine-grained analysis, you would have to download all the data and build something yourself.*

- Connectivity: A *Includes a bibliography linking inscriptions in the index to their scholarly description.*

## Kenchreai Archaeological Archive

- Permanence: B *Simple format image files indirectly avaliable for download from your browser.  Not an A because nothing on the site offers an easy way to download the entire collection of images at once.*

- Openness: A *Everything on the website is publicly avaliable.*

- Functionality: B *I can see everything, the cross-links are useful, and suggested citations are offered.  One drawback was that clicking into each individual notebook pagescan is cumbersome and it would be more convenient if you could scroll them.* 

- Connectivity: C *The site is self-contained.*
